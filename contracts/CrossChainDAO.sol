/* 

~~~~~~~ ON OPENZEPPELIN ~~~~~~
Code is generated from: https://www.openzeppelin.com/contracts
OpenZeppelin is a widely used smart contract framework that has significatly shaped standards in solidity smart contracts.
This smart contract relies on its governance and ERC-20 smart contracts for hub-chain DAO actions. The governance smart 
contracts from OpenZeppelin are also based off of Compound's DAO smart contracts.

~~~~~~~~ ON TIMELOCKS ~~~~~~~~
Notice that it doesn't have a Timelock. A timelock is used to delay the execution of a proposal after it has been completed
in case actors who disagree with the proposal want to exit the ecosystem before it is implemented. This is a common practice
and can be seen in giant governance schemes like Polkadot. However, this will not be included for this example for 
simplicity's sake.

~~~~~~~~~~ ON QUORUM ~~~~~~~~~
Typically, an OpenZeppelin Governor's quorum can be altered by democracy, but for simplicity's sake, the quorum has been 
reduced to a static value of 1 ether. This means that a single voter holding a single token can vote for a proposal and 
allow it to pass, even if there are 100k tokens in supply. Please view OpenZeppelin's GovernorVotesQuorumFraction smart 
contract if interested.
